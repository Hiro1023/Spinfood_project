Created classes :
- Calculation interface
- CRUTERUA enum
- ListManagement

edited classes : 
- Pair
- Group 



Idea behind the weighted algorithm : 
I have written 2 Methods in Pair/Group each one to calculate the total weight for a specific pair.
each Criteria ahs eben given a weiht based on its importance 
    FOOD_PREFERENCES(25),
    AGE_DIFFERENCE(10),
    GENDER_DIVERSITY(5),
    TRAVEL_DISTANCE(4),

Each one of those Criterias has a specific calculation methon, which is written in the Calculation interface.

Pair class : in this class the Calculation interface was implemented and each calculation method was implemented specified for Pairs
after that i wrote the calculatePairWeightedScore which takes a pair as a paramenters and calculates the sum of the Scores.
The Scores for each criteria is the weight times the return of each calculation method

Same logic was also applied to the Group class where Calculation interface was implemented for the Group class which basically takes each pair and returns the sum of the calculations for each pair for the methods. Same logic was also applied to the calculateGroupWeightScore


ListManagement Class :
 in List management class we have a dataList field to have access to the pairs and participants groups. And also a successorList (for later use)

methods :
editCriteria sets a new weight for a specific criteria

makeBestPairs:  creats a list of unmatchedParticipants to avoid them being matched again then it iterates thru each participant and call the makeBestPair method on it.
then it takes this matched pair and adds it to the pairList in dataList and it removes this pair from the unmatched pariticipants

makeBestPair iterates thru all participants in umatchedParticipants and makes sure atleast one of them has a kitchen. it also creats a temporary pair where it matches all the participants with each other and calls the calculatePairWeightedScore and the pair that returns the highest Score is returned as a Pair object. this iterates untill all the participants in unmatchedParticipants have been matched

Same logic is apploed in makeBestGroups/makeBestGroup


none applied criterias :

Wg count 
unassigned Participants handler



Ps. removePairFromList method from DataList.java : i removed the int indes parameter
